Simple implementation of a cobined heat and power plant (CHP).  The

The *CHP* consist of an engine, a generator and a heat exchanger.  It burns gas
and converts its energy into thermal and electrical power.  The CHP can be
driven at different *setpoints* â€“ at least *off* and *max. power (el., th.)*
(both in [W]).  The quotient *p_el_max* / *p_th_max* is called the *CHP
coefficient*.  If a CHP is turned off, it usually has to stay offline for
a while (*min_off_time* in [min]).

The thermal power is stored in a *HeatStorage* (a cistern) with a maximum
storage capacity *e_th_max* in [Wh].  The current capacity *e_th* is also
measured in [Wh].  It also constanly looses some heat with a rate of
*heat_loss*, in [W].  Its max. thermal power output *p_th_max* is measured in
[W].

A *Heater* backs up the *HeatStorage* and burns gas in order to heat water.

The *Controller* turns on the CHP if the heat storage is empty and turns it of
if it is full.  It may also receive a *setpoint* for the CHP from an external
source.

The model implemented so far is even simpler.  We don't yet model the heater,
storage heat loss and the storage's max. thermal power output.

The :class:`CHP` class doesn't model a single CHP, but a list of them using
NumPy arrays for performance reasons.  It gets configured with a list of
:class:`ChpConfig` instances which represent single CHPs.
